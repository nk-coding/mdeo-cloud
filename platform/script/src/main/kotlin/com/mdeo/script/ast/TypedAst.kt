/**
 * Root of the TypedAST containing all script program information.

 *
 * Note: Metamodel class definitions are now fetched separately via MetamodelData
 * and passed to the execution engine at runtime.
 *
 * @param types Array of all types used in the program. Generics are replaced by Any? due to
 *              type erasure. Types are indexed by typeIndex in expressions.
 * @param imports All imports in the program.
 * @param functions All top-level functions in the program.
