/**
 * Request sent by the orchestrator to allocate a worker for a new optimization run.
 *
 * Contains everything the worker needs to set up its local evaluation environment:
 * the metamodel, an initial model, pre-serialized transformation and script ASTs,
 * goal/solver configuration, and how many initial solutions to generate.
 *
 * @param executionId Unique identifier for the optimization execution.
 * @param metamodelData The metamodel that governs model structure.
 * @param initialModelData The seed model from which initial solutions derive.
 * @param transformationAstJsons Map of transformation path to its JSON-serialized
 *        [com.mdeo.modeltransformation.ast.TypedAst]. Workers deserialize these with
 *        the appropriate serializer modules on their side.
 * @param scriptAstJsons Map of script path to its JSON-serialized
 *        [com.mdeo.script.ast.TypedAst]. Workers deserialize these with the
 *        appropriate contextual serializer modules on their side.
 * @param goalConfig Objective and constraint definitions for fitness evaluation.
 * @param solverConfig Solver parameters (algorithm, population size, etc.).
 * @param initialSolutionCount Number of initial solutions the worker should generate
 *        and evaluate during allocation.
 * @param threadsPerNode Maximum threads this worker node should use, or `null` for no limit
 *        (falls back to the worker's own [com.mdeo.optimizerexecution.config.AppConfig.workerThreads]).
 * @param orchestratorWsUrl WebSocket URL for the worker's subprocess to connect back to the
 *        orchestrator. Mutually exclusive with [useLocalChannel].
 * @param useLocalChannel When `true`, the subprocess uses the existing stdin/stdout pipe to
 *        communicate with the orchestrator instead of opening a WebSocket connection.
 *        More efficient for the local node where subprocess and orchestrator share a host.
 *        Mutually exclusive with [orchestratorWsUrl].
