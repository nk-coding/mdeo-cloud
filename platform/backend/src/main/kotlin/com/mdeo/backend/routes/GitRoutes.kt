/**
 * Serves projects as git repositories over git's smart HTTP protocol.
 *
 * A client asks for the refs first, then posts a request describing what it
 * already has and wants. JGit's [UploadPack] implements both halves; all that
 * is needed here is to hand it the streams and get the framing right.
 *
 * These routes deliberately do not use the session cookie. Git clients send
 * HTTP basic credentials: the same MDEO username and password that works in
 * the browser works here, or a personal access token in place of the
 * password (the recommended option, since it is independently revocable and
 * never exposes the account password itself).
 *
 * @param gitRepositoryService Opens and publishes project repositories
 * @param projectService Used to check the caller may read the project
 * @param userService Used to verify basic credentials
 * @param personalAccessTokenService Used to verify a token offered in place of the account password
 * @param authRateLimiter Throttles failed basic-auth attempts, shared with the login route
 * @param trustedProxyHops How many reverse proxies sit in front of this backend; see
 *   [com.mdeo.backend.plugins.clientAddress]
 * @param webSocketNotificationService Notifies open workbench tabs after a push changes files
 * @param maxPushPackSizeBytes Largest pack a push may send; see [com.mdeo.backend.config.GitConfig]
